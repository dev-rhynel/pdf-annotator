# Enhanced PDF Viewer Features

## Overview

The PDF Annotator now includes an enhanced viewer with advanced features for better performance and user experience when working with large, high-resolution PDF documents.

## New Features

### 1. Zoom and Pan Support

- **Smooth Zooming**: Zoom in/out from 10% to 1000% with smooth transitions
- **Pan Navigation**: Click and drag to pan around the document
- **Zoom Controls**: Dedicated zoom buttons with percentage display
- **Reset View**: One-click button to return to 100% zoom and center position
- **Mouse Wheel Zoom**: Use mouse wheel to zoom in/out (when supported by browser)

### 2. High-Resolution Rendering

- **Crisp Display**: PDFs render at high resolution for sharp text and graphics
- **Retina Support**: Optimized for high-DPI displays
- **Scalable Rendering**: Maintains quality at all zoom levels
- **Performance Optimized**: Efficient rendering pipeline for smooth interactions

### 3. Tiling System

- **Dynamic Tiling**: PDF content is rendered in tiles for optimal performance
- **Lazy Loading**: Tiles are loaded on-demand as you pan and zoom
- **Overlap Handling**: Seamless tile boundaries with proper overlap
- **Memory Management**: Efficient memory usage with tile cleanup
- **Concurrent Rendering**: Multiple tiles render simultaneously for faster loading

### 4. Enhanced User Interface

- **Viewer Toggle**: Switch between Simple and Enhanced viewers
- **Zoom Indicator**: Real-time zoom percentage display
- **Loading States**: Visual feedback during tile rendering
- **Responsive Design**: Works across different screen sizes

## Technical Implementation

### Tiling Architecture

The tiling system divides the PDF into manageable chunks:

- **Tile Size**: 512x512 pixels (configurable)
- **Overlap**: 64 pixels between tiles for seamless rendering
- **Concurrent Rendering**: Up to 4 tiles render simultaneously
- **Viewport Calculation**: Dynamic tile calculation based on current view

### Performance Optimizations

- **Canvas-based Rendering**: Uses HTML5 Canvas for efficient graphics
- **Transform Handling**: Proper coordinate transformation for zoom/pan
- **Event Optimization**: Efficient mouse event handling with coordinate mapping
- **Memory Cleanup**: Automatic cleanup of unused tiles and canvases

### Browser Compatibility

- **Modern Browsers**: Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge
- **PDF.js Integration**: Uses PDF.js for PDF parsing and rendering
- **Fallback Support**: Graceful degradation to simple viewer if needed

## Usage

### Switching Between Viewers

1. Upload a PDF file
2. Use the "Viewer" toggle in the header to switch between:
   - **Enhanced**: Full zoom/pan/tiling support
   - **Simple**: Original viewer for basic annotation

### Zoom Controls

- **Zoom In/Out Buttons**: Click to adjust zoom level
- **Percentage Display**: Shows current zoom level
- **Reset Button**: Returns to 100% zoom and center position
- **Mouse Wheel**: Zoom in/out with mouse wheel (browser dependent)

### Pan Navigation

- **Click and Drag**: Click and drag to pan around the document
- **Smooth Movement**: Smooth panning with momentum
- **Boundary Handling**: Proper handling of document boundaries

## Performance Considerations

### Large Documents

- **Progressive Loading**: Tiles load progressively as you navigate
- **Memory Management**: Efficient memory usage with automatic cleanup
- **Rendering Queue**: Managed rendering queue to prevent browser freezing

### Zoom Levels

- **High Zoom**: Additional tiles load for detailed viewing
- **Low Zoom**: Fewer tiles needed for overview
- **Optimal Performance**: Balanced between quality and performance

## Future Enhancements

### Planned Features

- **Multi-page Support**: Navigate between pages with zoom/pan
- **Annotation Scaling**: Proper annotation scaling at all zoom levels
- **Export Options**: Export high-resolution annotated PDFs
- **Touch Support**: Touch gestures for mobile devices
- **Custom Tile Sizes**: User-configurable tile sizes for different use cases

### Performance Improvements

- **WebGL Rendering**: GPU-accelerated rendering for better performance
- **Worker Threads**: Background tile rendering in web workers
- **Caching**: Intelligent tile caching for frequently accessed areas
- **Compression**: Optimized tile compression for faster loading

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Slow Rendering**: Large documents may take time to render tiles
2. **Memory Usage**: Very large documents may use significant memory
3. **Browser Compatibility**: Some features may not work in older browsers

### Solutions

- **Use Simple Viewer**: Switch to simple viewer for basic annotation needs
- **Reduce Zoom**: Lower zoom levels require fewer tiles
- **Update Browser**: Use latest browser version for best performance
- **Close Other Tabs**: Free up memory by closing unnecessary browser tabs

## Technical Notes

### Dependencies

- `react-zoom-pan-pinch`: Zoom and pan functionality
- `pdfjs-dist`: PDF parsing and rendering
- `html2canvas`: Fallback rendering (if needed)

### File Structure

```
